Just Testing
Added new line of code
And what will happen now?
<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm editing this file from local comp while on GitHub I added another line in the meantime.
=======
Now I'm editing the text from github site, how will I know I need to pull that to my local repo?

Lalala, I'm modifying the file locally, but someone made in the meantime changes on the master branch on the same file. What will happen now? But this time, I will pull before push.
